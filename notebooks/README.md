### `03_monthly_comparison.ipynb`
Monthly comparison of REFSYS signal behavior across Feb–Apr (Set 1 & Set 2), including:
- Data loading from Excel sources and preprocessing (MJD + STTIME → datetime)
- Aggregation across satellites per timestamp
- Hourly resampling and volatility-based stability analysis
- Weather alignment (temperature, precipitation, pressure, wind) and correlation checks
- Urban multipath/building obstruction proxy using satellite elevation and azimuth geometry
- Combined analysis across months (seasonal + diurnal patterns) with regression-based feature importance

## Output
Key plots generated by the notebooks are saved in the root `/results` directory.

## How to run
Run notebooks from the project root directory so relative file paths resolve correctly:
```bash
jupyter notebook
