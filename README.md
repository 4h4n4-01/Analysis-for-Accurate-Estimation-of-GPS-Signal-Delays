## Analysis for Accurate Estimation of GPS Signal Delays
This repository contains the data processing pipelines, signal analysis scripts, and experimental notebooks developed as part of my Final Year Project at Nanyang Technological University (NTU), conducted in collaboration with A*STAR’s National Metrology Centre.

The project focuses on analysing GNSS receiver clock bias and GPS signal delays using CGGTTS data, investigating how environmental factors, satellite geometry, and surrounding infrastructure influence timing accuracy — with the long-term goal of improving low-cost GNSS receiver performance.

## Project Objectives
Analyse GPS receiver clock system offsets (REFSYS) from CGGTTS files
Study signal stability across different days, months, and locations

### Investigate effects of:
Satellite elevation & azimuth angles
Environmental conditions (temperature, pressure, rainfall, wind)
Urban obstructions & multipath risk
Quantify signal volatility and long-term timing drift
Build foundations for future ML-based clock bias correction models

## Key Analyses Performed

### Time Transfer & Clock Stability
Average REFSYS vs time (daily & monthly)
Long-term drift trends
Monthly stability boxplots

### Satellite Geometry Effects
Elevation angle vs REFSYS (multipath sensitivity)
Azimuth angle vs volatility (urban reflection zones)

### Environmental Impact
REFSYS vs temperature, pressure, rainfall, wind speed
Weather-driven volatility comparisons

### Urban Obstruction Risk
Building reflection risk proxy analysis
Signal instability by direction & elevation

### Temporal Behaviour
Day vs night volatility comparison
Hourly resampled stability metrics

## Results
The results/ folder contains:
Monthly REFSYS trend plots
Stability boxplots
Elevation & azimuth impact visualisations
Weather correlation graphs
Volatility comparison charts

These outputs provide quantitative insights into GPS timing degradation under real-world conditions.

## Tools & Technologies
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)
CGGTTS time transfer format
RTKLib & RINEX preprocessing
Jupyter Notebooks
Statistical volatility & trend analysis

## Key Findings
Low-cost GNSS receivers exhibit large clock system offsets (REFSYS)

### Signal stability varies with:
Satellite geometry
Environmental conditions
Urban reflection effects
Weather and obstruction effects measurably increase volatility
Timing drift trends remain consistent across months but differ by environment

## Future Work
Machine learning models for clock bias correction
Real-time GNSS error mitigation frameworks
Broader environmental datasets
Cross-receiver performance benchmarking
